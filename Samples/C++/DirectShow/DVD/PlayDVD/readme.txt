Description
===========

PlayDVD is a simple windowed DVD player based on the PlayWnd sample.
It allows you to render a DVD volume, watch movies, determine whether
closed captioning and subpicture streams are displayed, adjust the
playback rate and window size, and navigate the DVD menus with the
keyboard or the mouse.

It does not implement all of the features provided by the DVD interfaces.
For a more detailed sample, see the DVDSample folder.

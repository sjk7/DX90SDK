    ' Step 1: Define the game actions. 
    '         
    ' One of the big advantages of using action mapping to assist with game input
    ' is that it allows you to handle input in terms of game actions instead of
    ' device objects. For instance, this sample defines a small set of actions
    ' appropriate for a simple hand to hand combat game. When polling for user
    ' input, the data can be handled in terms of kicks and punches instead of
    ' button presses, axis movements, and keystrokes. This also allows to user
    ' to customize the controls without any further effort on the part of the
    ' developer.
    '
    ' Each game action will be represented within your program as a 32 bit value.
    ' For this sample, the game actions correspond to indices within an array.

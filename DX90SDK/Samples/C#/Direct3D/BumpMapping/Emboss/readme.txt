Description
===========
   The Emboss sample demonstrates an alternative approach to standard
   Direct3D bump mapping. Embossing is done by subtracting the height map
   from itself and having texture coordinates that are slightly changed.

   Not all cards support Direct3D bump mapping. Refer to the Microsoft DirectX® 
   software development kit (SDK) documentation for more information.

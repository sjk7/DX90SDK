Description
===========

This sample demonstrates how to recompress a video/audio
source file into another file with a different compression type.

You can convert MPG, QT, AVI, or any video file that DirectShow
supports into an AVI file, as long as you have the appropriate
compressors and decompressors.  Note, however, that some compressors
cannot be used if they have Digital Rights Management (DRM)
built into them or if the compressors just are not functioning 
in the manner expected by this sample.

You can view the input and output files in the embedded
video screen to compare quality between two files.

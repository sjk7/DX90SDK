Description
===========
   This sample mimics a metaball effect in screen space using a pixel shader.
   True metaball techniques deform meshes according to pushing or pulling
   modifiers, and are commonly used to model liquid effects like the merging
   of water droplets; however, metaball effects can be computationally
   expensive, and this sample shows how to fake a 3D metaball effect in 2D
   image space using a pixel shader.

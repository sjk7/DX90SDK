' Desc: Now that we know how to create a device and render some 2D vertices,
'       this tutorial goes the next step and renders 3D geometry. To deal with
'       3D geometry we need to introduce the use of 4x4 matrices to transform
'       the geometry with translations, rotations, scaling, and setting up our
'       camera.
'
'       Geometry is defined in model space. We can move it (translation),
'       rotate it (rotation), or stretch it (scaling) using a world transform.
'       The geometry is then said to be in world space. Next, we need to
'       position the camera, or eye point, somewhere to look at the geometry.
'       Another transform, via the view matrix, is used, to position and
'       rotate our view. With the geometry then in view space, our last
'       transform is the projection transform, which "projects" the 3D scene
'       into our 2D viewport.
'
'       Note that in this tutorial, we are introducing the use of D3DX, which
'       is a set of helper utilities for D3D. In this case, we are using some
'       of D3DX's useful matrix initialization functions. To use D3DX, simply
'       include the D3DX reference in your project

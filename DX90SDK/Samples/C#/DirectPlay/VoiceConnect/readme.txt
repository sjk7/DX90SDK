  The VoiceConnect differs by letting clients use DirectPlay Voice to talk
  to each other using a computer microphone.  Here's how this is done:
  
  * Initialize DirectPlayVoice.  
       Before using voice you need a to establish a DirectPlay Voice session.
       
         - Tests the audio setup with DirectPlay Voice. 
         - If hosting, then we create the voice session:  
          - If either hosting or joining, then connect to the session. 
  * Handle voice client messages.

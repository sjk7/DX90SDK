' Desc: Better than just lights and materials, 3D objects look much more
'       convincing when texture-mapped. Textures can be thought of as a sort
'       of wallpaper, that is shrinkwrapped to fit a texture. Textures are
'       typically loaded from image files, and D3DX provides a utility to
'       function to do this for us. Like a vertex buffer, textures have
'       Lock() and Unlock() functions to access (read or write) the image
'       data. Textures have a width, height, miplevel, and pixel format. The
'       miplevel is for "mipmapped" textures, an advanced performance-
'       enhancing feature which uses lower resolutions of the texture for
'       objects in the distance where detail is less noticeable. The pixel
'       format determines how the colors are stored in a texel. The most
'       common formats are the 16-bit R5G6B5 format (5 bits of red, 6-bits of
'       green and 5 bits of blue) and the 32-bit A8R8G8B8 format (8 bits each
'       of alpha, red, green, and blue).
'
'       Textures are associated with geometry through texture coordinates.
'       Each vertex has one or more sets of texture coordinates, which are
'       named tu and tv and range from 0.0 to 1.0. Texture coordinates can be
'       supplied by the geometry, or can be automatically generated using
'       Direct3D texture coordinate generation (which is an advanced feature).

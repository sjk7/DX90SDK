' Desc: Rendering 3D geometry is much more interesting when dynamic lighting
'       is added to the scene. To use lighting in D3D, you must create one or
'       more lights, setup a material, and make sure your geometry contains surface
'       normals. Lights may have a position, a color, and be of a certain type
'       such as directional (light comes from one direction), point (light
'       comes from a specific x,y,z coordinate and radiates in all directions)
'       or spotlight. Materials describe the surface of your geometry,
'       specifically, how it gets lit (diffuse color, ambient color, etc.).
'       Surface normals are part of a vertex, and are needed for the D3D's
'       internal lighting calculations.

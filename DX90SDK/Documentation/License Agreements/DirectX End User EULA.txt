Accompanying this Agreement is a pre-release copy of the Microsoft product identified above, which may include software (the “Software”) and related documentation and information (collectively the “Product”). The Product is protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. The Product is licensed, not sold.  
1.	GRANT OF LICENSE.  This Agreement grants Recipient the following rights provided that Recipient complies with all terms and conditions of this Agreement: 
	
	(a)	Microsoft grants to Recipient a limited, non-exclusive, nontransferable, royalty-free license to install and use up to five (5) copies of the executable code of the Product on a single CPU residing on Recipient’s premises, solely to test the compatibility of Recipient’s application or other product(s) which operate in conjunction with the Product and to evaluate the Product for the purpose of providing feedback thereon to Microsoft.  All other rights are reserved to Microsoft.  Recipient shall not rent, lease, sell, sublicense, assign, or otherwise transfer any portion of the Product.  Recipient may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble any portion of the Product, except and only to the extent that this limitation is expressly prohibited by applicable law notwithstanding this limitation.  

	(b)	 Recipient agrees to provide to Microsoft reasonable suggestions, comments and feedback regarding the Product, including but not limited to usability, bug reports and test results, with respect to Product testing (collectively, “Feedback”). Recipient grants Microsoft, under all of Recipient’s intellectual property and proprietary rights, the following worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty free, fully paid up rights: (1) to make, use, copy, modify, and create derivative works of, the Feedback as part of any Microsoft product, technology, service, specification or other documentation (collectively, “Microsoft Offerings”),  (2) to publicly perform or display, import, broadcast, transmit, distribute, license, offer to sell, and sell, rent, lease or lend copies of the Feedback (and derivative works thereof) as part of any Microsoft Offering, (3) solely with respect to Recipient’s copyright and trade secret rights, to sublicense to third parties the foregoing rights, including the right to sublicense to further third parties, and (4) to sublicense to third parties any claims of any patents owned or licensable by Recipient that are necessarily infringed by a third party product, technology or service that uses, interfaces, interoperates or communicates with the Feedback or portion thereof incorporated into a Microsoft product, technology or service. Further, Recipient warrants that Recipient’s Feedback is not subject to license terms that will require, or claim to require, that any Microsoft Offering that incorporates any Feedback  (or any intellectual property therein) be licensed to any third party on specified terms.  Due to the nature of the development work, Microsoft provides no assurance that any specific errors or discrepancies in the Product will be corrected.

	(c)	Recipient may disclose the Product only to its employees who have a need to know in order to accomplish the purposes identified in Section 1(a), and such employees’ use of the Product shall take place solely at Recipient’s site.  Recipient will have executed appropriate written agreements with its employees sufficient to enable it to comply with the terms of this Agreement.  

	(d)	Recipient agrees that, for a period of up to six (6) months after commercial release of the Product, it will maintain a list of all employees who have had access hereunder to the Product or related information and provide such list to Microsoft upon Microsoft’s request.

	(e)	In the event Microsoft, in its sole discretion, elects to provide deliveries of Product to more than one individual employed by Recipient (if Recipient is not a single individual), each such recipient shall be entitled to exercise the rights granted in this Agreement, and shall be bound by the terms and conditions herein.

2.	TERM OF AGREEMENT. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date accepted by Recipient and shall continue until terminated by Microsoft in writing at any time, with or without cause.  This Agreement will terminate without notice upon the earlier of (i) commercial release of the Software contained in the Product or (ii) one year after the last date Recipient receives the Product or any Update thereto, unless terminated earlier by Microsoft.

However, Microsoft may, in its sole discretion, provide further pre-release versions, technical support, updates and/or supplements of the Product and/or related information (“Updates”) to Recipient hereunder, in which case such Updates shall also be deemed to be included in the “Product” and the “Software” and therefore governed by this Agreement, unless other terms of use are provided by Microsoft with such Updates.  In no event shall Microsoft be obligated to provide Recipient a copy of the commercial release version of the Product in connection with Recipient’s participation in the testing program.

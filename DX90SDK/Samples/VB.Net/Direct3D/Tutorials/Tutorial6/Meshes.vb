' Desc: For advanced geometry, most apps will prefer to load pre-authored
'       meshes from a file. Fortunately, when using meshes, D3DX does most of
'       the work for this, parsing a geometry file and creating vertx buffers
'       (and index buffers) for us. This tutorial shows how to use a D3DXMESH
'       object, including loading it from a file and rendering it. One thing
'       D3DX does not handle for us is the materials and textures for a mesh,
'       so note that we have to handle those manually.
'
'       Note: one advanced (but nice) feature that we don't show here is that
'       when cloning a mesh we can specify the FVF. So, regardless of how the
'       mesh was authored, we can add/remove normals, add more texture
'       coordinate sets (for multi-texturing), etc.

'
' Desc: The main game file for the ChatPeer sample.  It connects 
'       players together with dialog boxes to prompt users on the 
'       connection settings to join or create a session. After the user 
'       connects to a session, the sample displays the chat dialog. 
' 
'       After a new game has started the sample begins a very simplistic 
'       chat session where users can send text to each other.
'      
'       This sample Interops with the C++ and C# version of the 
'       sample as well.

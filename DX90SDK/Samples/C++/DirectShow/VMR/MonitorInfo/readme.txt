This is a simple demonstration of information that can
be retrieved from the Video Mixing Renderer's IVMRMonitorConfig
interface.  The sample enumerates the available monitors
in the system and their associated dimensions, flags, handle,
name, and optional description.  A text string is created
which contains the queried information, which is then displayed
in a message box.


NOTE: This sample requires Windows XP (or greater) functionality 
and will exit on other systems.

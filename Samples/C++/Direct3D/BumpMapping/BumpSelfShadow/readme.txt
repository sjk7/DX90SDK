Description
===========
Self Shadowed Bumpmaps project includes all source and content for the self
shadowing bump map algorithm presented at the 2001 GDC lecture by Dan Baker and
Chas Boyd. This app will run without pixel shaders, as long as the hardware has
rendertargets and DOT3. However, it runs much more efficently with pixel shaders
and with better visual results.

Source files
===========
     main.cpp        App main file
     shadowset.cpp   All the code for the self-shadowed bump map
   
     d3dapp.cpp      The App framework already included on the DX 8 sdk
     d3dfont.cpp     These files are provided for conveince only
     d3dutil.cpp     and should be replaced with newer files from the
     dxutil.cpp      sdk on newer releases of DirectX.
